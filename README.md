# CHAPTER_8
##Creating an App's Navigation

In Chapter 8, I focus on mastering navigation techniques in Flutter to build user-friendly and intuitive apps. I learn how to use the Navigator widget to switch between pages seamlessly, providing smooth transitions throughout the app. Additionally, I explore hero animations, which allow widgets to fly from one page to another, creating visually engaging effects during navigation

I also dive into creating a BottomNavigationBar with BottomNavigationBarItems, which includes icons and titles for easy navigation between main sections of an app. Enhancing this further, I use the BottomAppBar widget to design customizable navigation bars with advanced features like notches for FloatingActionButtons.

For tabbed navigation, I utilize TabBar and TabBarView to create horizontal rows of tabs and display content associated with each tab. This provides users with a convenient way to switch between different views.

Finally, I implement the Drawer widget, enabling a sliding panel for side menus, and the ListView widget to build scrollable lists efficiently. By combining ListView with Drawer, I can create functional menu lists to improve app accessibility.
